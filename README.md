Reach is a simple platformer game built with [Phaser](http://phaser.io) for the course

## Setup

On this branch (`gh-pages`), all dependencies are allready cached. All you need to do is to fire up 
a http server,  such as the  excellent [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server)
and point it to the root of this repo.
